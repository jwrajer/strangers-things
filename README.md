# Stranger's Things

 I didn't get to add edit/delete button for posts, but that was mostly likely next. If messages existed it would break the dashboard unless I do a quick .map to it.

I do recognize that I switched halfway from refering to posts as listings

Tried my best with the routes to hide the ability to see create forms etc when not logged in
